Welcome to Kontiki!
===================

Kontiki, or the *Continuous-Time Toolkit*, is a toolkit for optimization-based, continuous-time, structure from motion.
In short, it can estimate a camera trajectory and 3D structure from a set of measurements, and it does so using
a continuous-time trajectory.
